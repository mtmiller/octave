%%  Test script for legacy OOP.
%%  Requires the path to contain the directory ctor-vs-method.
%%
%%  Note: This script and all classes are also intended to run
%%        in Matlab to test compatibility.  Don't break that!

%% FIXME: Can't use 'clear -classes' because it also clears all functions in the
%% namespace of test.m (bug #35881).  This is a problem only if Octave would
%% re-use a class definition that was defined somewhere else.  Unfortunately,
%% that is exactly the case when running 'make check' since the ctor-vs-method
%% test also uses an @parent, @derived, and @other class.
%% Until the bug is fixed, it suffices to make the class names unique so that
%% there is no re-use.  Using the prefix fhdr (fcn-handle/derived-resolution)
%% for this directory.
