## üöÄ Kick-off ‚öΩ ##

------------------------------------------------------------

### ‚öôÔ∏è Update stable and default branch to new version numbers ###

Completion Date:

* Merge default onto stable to become the current stable release (see
  instructions in `etc/HACKING.md`).
* Bump version numbers in `configure.ac` on stable branch (see
  `etc/HACKING.md`).
* Bump version numbers in `configure.ac` on default branch (see
  `etc/HACKING.md`).
* Create new `etc/NEWS.VERSION+1.md` file on default branch by copying
  `etc/NEWS.VERSION.md` and then removing text so that it is a template file
  with headings only.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Update gnulib to latest version ###

Completion Date:

**Must occur first** as it could resolve existing, or create new, bug reports.
You should run `./bootstrap` in the source tree after updating to the new
gnulib version.

### üì¢ Call for bug reports ###

Completion Date:

* Put out a general call for reports on [Octave Discourse](https://octave.discourse.group/) for all outstanding, but unreported, known bugs.
* Create Savannah `Release` tag `VERSION.0.90` on bug tracker for 1st release
  candidate.
* Mark items that should be fixed for the release with this tag.
* Update Savannah `Planned Release` and `Fixed Release` tags by adding
  `VERSION.1.0 (current stable)` and `VERSION+1.1.0 (current default)`.
* Review bug overview at <https://octave.space/savannah/>.

### üì¢ Update GUI translation files ###

Completion Date:

* Call for updates ([Octave Discourse](https://octave.discourse.group/)) that
  might change GUI strings.
* String freeze date:
* Update language translation files (`*.ts`).  See instructions in
  `libgui/languages/build_ts/README.md`.
* Create bug report on Savannah as a centralized location for uploading files
  and tracking status of translations.
* Call for translations of GUI strings on [Octave Discourse Maintainers](https://octave.discourse.group/c/maintainers/7), CC-ing the translators (see [list of translators](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/tip/libgui/languages/translators)).
* Collect translation files on Savannah bug report and push to Mercurial.

### ‚öñÔ∏è GPL License activities ###

Completion Date:

* Update copyright statements for all source controlled files.

    Command to update copyright notifications

    `hg locate | xargs sed -i 's/Copyright (C) \([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\)-2023 The Octave Project Developers/Copyright (C) \1-2024 The Octave Project Developers/; s/Copyright (C) 2023 The Octave Project Developers/Copyright (C) 2023-2024 The Octave Project Developers/'`

    Command to check results before checking in

    `hg diff | grep ^[-+][^-+] | sed 's/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-/YYYY-/' | sort -u`

* Update dates in any other locations (`CITATION`, MXE `README.html` file).
* Add any new contributors to `doc/interpreter/contributors.in` who wish to be
  mentioned (don't add them without permission).

### ‚úÖ Style-check code base ###

Completion Date:

This will produce lots of whitespace changes, but no behavior changes. **Must
occur after patches have been added**, since whitespace changes can prevent
patches from applying.

* [m-file style check](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_style_guide)
* [C++ style check](https://wiki.octave.org/C%2B%2B_style_guide)

### üìñ Review documentation ###

Completion Date:

* Grammar check documentation (See `doc/interpreter/doccheck/README`).
* Spell check documentation (`make spellcheck`).
* Verify no functions missing from manual
  (`make doc/interpreter/undocumented_list`).
* Verify deprecated functions removed from manual (`*.txi`) and from "see also"
  links.
* Verify all formats (Info, HTML, PDF) build correctly.
* Review `etc/NEWS.VERSION.md` for any features which should be announced.
* Review `__unimplemented__.m` for the latest changes to
  [Octave Forge](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_Forge) packages and new Matlab
  functions.
* Update `installer-files/README.html` in MXE Octave with version highlights.

## üîÉ Repeat until all bugs are resolved ##

------------------------------------------------------------

Completion Date of first iteration:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current state at Savannah ###

Bug overview at <https://octave.space/savannah/>.

### ‚úÖ `make check` ###

* Verify `make check` is passing on all [buildbot combinations of OS and compilers](http://buildbot.octave.org:8010/#/waterfall) and [GitHub CI runners](https://github.com/gnu-octave/octave/actions).  Also check [test suite runs on "freshly brewed Octave for Windows"](https://github.com/gnu-octave/octave-buildbot/actions) (Kai's buildbots on octave.space).
* Use software tools to check quality of Octave code.
  * Check for memory leaks by configuring with
    `--enable-address-sanitizer-flags` and compiling with
    `-g -O0 -fno-optimize-sibling-calls` in `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, and
    `LDFLAGS`.
  * Check for bad memory accesses by compiling with
    `-g -O0 -fsanitize=undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer
    -fno-optimize-sibling-calls` in `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS`.
  * Update static code analysis results.
      * For `clang`, do `scan-build make -j<N> all` and then `scan-view`.
      * See [PVS static analyzer - 5.0 Release](https://wiki.octave.org/PVS_static_analyzer_-_5.0_Release).
  * Use other tools such as `cppcheck`, etc.
* Start discussion on [Octave Discourse Maintainers](https://octave.discourse.group/c/maintainers/8) about which failing tests that must be fixed and which can be declared **WON'T FIX**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Create new release candidate ###

* Ensure correct version information (see "Release Numbering" in
  `/etc/HACKING.md`).
* Create `hg tag` in repository with release candidate version number
  (`rc-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH`).

* Upload release candidates to <https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/octave/>.
* Check [Windows Installer](https://wiki.octave.org/Windows_Installer)
  (executable and zip formats) against false positive detection at
  [virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com/).
* Add release candidate version to Savannah bug tracker.
* Announce release candidate to
  [Octave Discourse](https://octave.discourse.group/).
