Hacking Octave
==============

This file attempts to describe the rules to use when hacking the
Octave sources cloned from the Savannah source code
[repository](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/).
**DO NOT** put this file into the distribution.  These requirements
do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install all the required dependencies.  Precisely how to do that
   depends on what type of system you are using.  There are more
   details below.

2. Clone the Octave sources:

       hg clone https://www.octave.org/hg/octave

3. Change to the top-level directory of the Octave source tree and
   run the `bootstrap` script:

       cd octave
       ./bootstrap

4. Create a build directory, `cd` to it, then run `configure` and
   `make`, or `make -jX` (to run `X` simultaneous jobs):

       mkdir .build
       cd .build
       ../configure
       make -j2

Requirements
------------

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges, etc.), but imposes
more requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-cloned
sources.  For example, you have to use the latest stable versions of
the maintainer tools we depend upon.  These include:

- [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
- [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
- [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- [Flex](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/)
- [Gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [gperf](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/)
- [Gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/)
- [Libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
- [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
- [Perl](https://www.cpan.org/)
- [Rsync](https://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/)
- [Tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)

In addition to these maintainer tools, Octave makes use of many
external libraries and packages.  See `doc/interpreter/install.txi`
for the complete list of required and optional dependencies.

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful.
Later, after synchronizing from the repository, a plain `make` should
be sufficient.

First clone
-----------

If you are reading these notes, you may have already managed to clone
this package from the repository.  For the record, you will find all
the relevant information on downloading sources at:

  <https://www.octave.org/download.html>

After cloning Octave, you will need to run the `bootstrap` script:

    ./bootstrap

This script will examine the source tree and generate some `Makefile`
fragments, then run autotools scripts to generate `Makefile.in` files
from `Makefile.am` files and create the `configure` script.  The
`bootstrap` script comes from gnulib, but is kept in the Octave
source archive.  It should be updated from the gnulib sources as
necessary.

If you have a copy of gnulib in some directory apart from the Octave
source tree, then pass the name of the directory containing
`gnulib-tool` to the `bootstrap` script using the option:

    --gnulib-srcdir=DIRNAME

If you have downloaded gnulib directly, `DIRNAME` will be the
directory where gnulib was unpacked.  If you have installed gnulib
using a package manager, `DIRNAME` is likely to be `/usr/bin` or
`/usr/local/bin` (where the gnulib-tool script resides).

By using an external gnulib directory, you can share a single gnulib
source tree among several projects.  From 2011 until 2020, the gnulib
sources were a Mercurial subrepository of the Octave repository, so they
will be automatically updated to the corresponding Mercurial revision if
you update the working directory to a revision in that time period.
In 2020, the gnulib Mercurial subrepository was deleted.  Instead, the
`bootstrap` script is used to fetch and update to a marked revision of
the gnulib git repository.  A working copy of the gnulib git repository
will be automatically updated to the matching revision (see the default
value of `GNULIB_REVISION` in `bootstrap.conf`) when you run the
`bootstrap` script after you updated the working directory to a revision
after that point in time.  A working `git` installation is necessary.

Additional options besides `--gnulib-srcdir` can be passed to
`bootstrap` and they will be forwarded without modification to the
gnulib `bootstrap` script.

Once the `bootstrap` script completes successfully, you may configure
and build Octave.  We recommend that you build Octave in a separate
directory tree from the sources.  For example, if you have just
finished running the `bootstrap` script in the top-level source
directory, run the following commands to create a build tree,
configure, and build Octave:

    mkdir .build
    cd .build
    ../configure
    make -j2
    make check

The `-j2` after the first `make` call means, that two jobs run
simultaneously.  This number may be increased depending on your
system.  At this point, there should be no difference between your
working tree and the currently visited hg revision:

    hg diff

should output no difference.

Coding style
------------

The most important advice is to follow any conventions you detect
in the file being edited.  In addition, Octave maintainers have
written a lot on the subject.  See
<https://wiki.octave.org/Contribution_guidelines>.

Bugs and patches
----------------

See the file BUGS in this directory for more guidance on reporting bugs
and preparing patches.

Source code directory layout
----------------------------

An overview of the directory layout of Octave's source files:

- `build-aux`
     scripts which support the build process.

- `doc`
     Texinfo and Doxygen documentation for Octave.

- `etc`
     miscellaneous files, such as this `HACKING` howto.

- `examples`
     some example files (`mkoctfile` and mex samples, old class
     programming interface).

- `gnulib`
     gnulib repository.  This is a working copy of the gnulib git
     repository.  We usually don't want to update gnulib sources when
     going from one stable point release to the next.

- `libgnu`
     gnulib sources that we use.  These files are copied here from the
     gnulib directory by the `bootstrap` script.

- `liboctave`
    C++ interfaces to the numerical libraries, Fortran numerical
    libraries, various OS facilities, and utility functions.
  - `array`
       the base `Array`, `NDArray`, `Matrix`, and `Sparse` classes.
  - `external`
       various numerical libraries (mostly Fortran).
    - `amos`        bessel functions
    - `blas-xtra`   wrappers for blas functions used in Octave
    - `daspk`       large scale differential algebraic equation solver
    - `dasrt`       differential algebraic equation solver with root finding
    - `dassl`       differential-algebraic system solver

       code for operators that act on base classes (such as `Array`).
  - `system`
       OS-related functions.
  - `util`
       utility and miscellaneous functions.
  - `wrappers`
       C++ wrappers for gnulib functions written in C.

- `libinterp`
     the interpreter itself plus lots of infrastructure around it.
     Octave's extensive `octave_value` class hierarchy for
     polymorphically handling all Octave types is defined here.
     The built-in functions are also defined here.
  - `octave-value`
       the `octave_value` class hierarchy.  These are the container
       classes that hold various Octave data types like struct
       numerical arrays, structure arrays, and cell arrays.
  - `parse-tree`
       Classes that define the parse tree for the interpreter.

       the interpreter.
  - `dldfcn`
       dynamically linked `DEFUN_DLD` functions (callable from the
       scripting language).  If you see `help foo` telling you that
       `foo` is defined in `foo.oct`, then `foo.cc` will be found
       here and contain the source code.

Release Numbering
-----------------

Since version 5, Octave uses the following rules for release numbering:

  Version Dev Phase       When

  5.0.0   (experimental)  active development of Octave 5 on default branch
  5.0.1   (pre-release)   stabilization period of Octave 5 on stable branch
  5.0.90  (pre-release)   first release candidate for 5.1.0
  5.0.91  (pre-release)   continued stabilization of Octave 5 on stable branch
  6.0.0   (experimental)  active development of Octave 6 on default branch
  5.1.0   (release)       first release of Octave 5 from stable branch
  5.1.1   (pre-release)   bug fixing on stable branch after 5.1.0 release
  5.2.0   (release)       second release of Octave 5 from stable branch
  5.2.1   (pre-release)   bug fixing on stable branch after 5.2.0 release
  ...

To summarize, the first release of Octave 5 will be Octave 5.1.0 while
development snapshots will be Octave 5.0.0 and snapshots from the
release branch Octave 5.n.1.

With this numbering scheme:

  * Any version X.0.0 means "this is an experimental development
    version".

  * Any version X.Y.Z with Z > 0 means, "this is a pre-release version
    meant for bug fixing and testing".  In practice, Z will be either 1
    (stabilization period after and before making release candidates) or
    90, 92, etc. (release candidate snapshots leading up to release).
    91, 93, etc. (stabilization period on stable branch during the
    process of making release candidates).

  * Any version X.Y.0 with Y != 0 means "this is a released version".

Shared Library Versioning
-------------------------

Version numbers for the liboctave, liboctinterp, and liboctgui shared
libraries are set in the module.mk files in the top-level directory for
each library using the variables

  %canon_reldir%_%canon_reldir%_current
  %canon_reldir%_%canon_reldir%_revision
  %canon_reldir%_%canon_reldir%_age

The rules for updating these version numbers are:

  * Start with version information of `0:0:0` for each libtool library.

  * Update the version information only immediately before a public
    release of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary,
    and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger
    faster.

  * If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
    then increment revision (`c:r:a` becomes `c:r+1:a`).

  * If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
    last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.

  * If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
    then increment age.

  * If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public
    release, then set age to 0.

Never try to set the interface numbers so that they correspond to the
Octave version number.  This is an abuse that only fosters
misunderstanding of the purpose of library versions.

The following explanation may help to understand the above rules a bit
better: consider that there are three possible kinds of reactions from
users of your library to changes in a shared library:

  * Programs using the previous version may use the new version as
    drop-in replacement, and programs using the new version can also
    work with the previous one.  In other words, no recompiling nor
    relinking is needed.  In this case, bump revision only, don’t touch
    current nor age.

  * Programs using the previous version may use the new version as
    drop-in replacement, but programs using the new version may use APIs
    not present in the previous one.  In other words, a program linking
    against the new version may fail with unresolved symbols if linking
    against the old version at runtime: set revision to 0, bump current
    and age.

  * Programs may need to be changed, recompiled, and relinked in order
    to use the new version.  Bump current, set revision and age to 0.

These guidelines also appear in the GNU libtool manual, see
https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html.
