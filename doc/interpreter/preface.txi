@cindex history

Octave was originally intended to be companion software for an
undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor design being written by
@nospell{James B. Rawlings} of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
@nospell{John G. Ekerdt} of the University of Texas.

Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware' package
with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our initial goals
were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create something that
would enable students to solve realistic problems, and that they could
use for many things other than chemical reactor design problems.
We find that most students pick up the basics of Octave quickly, and are
using it confidently in just a few hours.

Although it was originally intended to be used to teach reactor design,
it has been used in several other undergraduate and graduate
courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of
Texas, and the math department at the University of Texas has been using
it for teaching differential equations and linear algebra as well.
More recently, Octave has been used as the primary computational tool
for teaching Stanford's online Machine Learning class
(@url{http://ml-class.org}) taught by Andrew Ng.  Tens of thousands of students
participated in the course.

If you find Octave useful, please let us know.  We are always interested
to find out how Octave is being used.

Virtually everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with
music, but it is actually the name of one of John W. Eaton's former
professors who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering,
and who was also well known for his ability to do quick `back of the
envelope' calculations.  We hope that this software will make it
possible for many people to do more ambitious computations just as
easily.

Everyone is encouraged to share this software with others under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (@pxref{Copying}).  You are
also encouraged to help make Octave more useful by writing and
contributing additional functions for it, and by reporting any problems
you may have.

@cindex Citations

In view of the many contributions made by numerous developers over many years
it is common courtesy to cite Octave in publications when it has been used
during the course of research or the preparation of figures.  The
@code{citation} function can automatically generate a recommended citation
text for Octave or any of its packages.  See the help text below on how to
use @code{citation}.

@cindex funding Octave development

There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave a
better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to write
high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your code freely
available for others to use.  See
@url{https://www.octave.org/get-involved.html} for detailed information.

If you find Octave useful, consider providing additional funding to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that is
available for development and support.

Donations supporting Octave development may be made on the web at
@url{https://my.fsf.org/donate/working-together/octave}.  These
donations also help to support the Free Software Foundation

If you'd prefer to pay by check or money order, you can do so by sending
a check to the FSF at the following address:

@noindent
If you pay by check, please be sure to write ``GNU Octave'' in the memo
field of your check.

If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs you find and
by offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.  @xref{Trouble}, for
tips on how to write useful bug reports.
