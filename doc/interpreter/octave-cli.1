.TH OCTAVE-CLI 1 "03 January 2014" "GNU Octave"
.SH NAME
octave-cli \- A high-level interactive language for numerical computations.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBoctave-cli\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... [\fIfile\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  \fBoctave-cli\fP
has been compiled without any GUI support (Qt) which makes it smaller
than the default \fBoctave\fP executable, but also limits it to
providing just the command line interface (CLI).
.SH OPTIONS
The complete set of command-line options for \fBoctave-cli\fP is available
by running the following command from the shell.
.Vb

    octave-cli \-\-help
.Ve
.SH DOCUMENTATION
The primary documentation for Octave is written using Texinfo, the GNU
documentation system, which allows the same source files to be used to
produce online and printed versions of the manual.
.PP
You can read the online copy of the Octave documentation by issuing
the following command from within Octave.
.Vb

    octave:1> doc

.Ve
The Info files may also be read with a stand-alone program such as
\fBinfo\fP or \fBxinfo\fP.  HTML, Postscript, or PDF versions of the
documentation are installed on many systems as well.
.SH BUGS
The Octave project maintains a bug tracker at https://bugs.octave.org.
Before submitting a new item please read the instructions at
https://www.octave.org/bugs.html on how to submit a useful report.
.SH FILES
Upon startup Octave looks for four initialization files.  Each file
may contain any number of valid Octave commands.
.TP
\fIoctave-home\fP/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc
Site-wide initialization file which changes options for all users.
\fIoctave-home\fP is the directory where Octave was installed such as
\fB/usr/local\fP.
.TP
\fIoctave-home\fP/share/octave/\fIversion\fP/m/startup/octaverc
Site-wide initialization file for Octave version \fIversion\fP.
.TP
~/.octaverc
User's personal initialization file.
.TP
\&\.octaverc
Project-specific initialization file located in the current directory.
