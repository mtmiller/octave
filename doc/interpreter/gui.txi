@node GUI Development
@chapter GUI Development

Octave is principally a batch or command-line language.  However, it does
offer some features for constructing graphical interfaces that interact with
users.

The GUI elements available are I/O dialogs, a progress bar, and UI elements
for plot windows.  For example, rather than hardcoding a filename for output
results a script can open a dialog box and allow the user to choose a file.
Similarly, if a calculation is expected to take a long time a script can
display a progress bar.  The various UI elements can be used to fully customize
the plot window with menubars, toolbars, context menus, pushbuttons, sliders,
etc.

Several utility functions make it possible to store private data for use with
a GUI which will not pollute the user's variable space.

Finally, a program written in Octave might want to have long term storage of
preferences or state variables.  This can be done with user-defined
preferences.

@node I/O Dialogs
@section I/O Dialogs

Simple dialog menus are available for choosing directories or files.  They
return a string variable which can then be used with any command requiring
a filename.

@DOCSTRING(uigetdir)

@cindex dialog, displaying a dialog for selecting files
@DOCSTRING(uigetfile)

Additionally, there are dialog boxes for displaying help messages, warnings, or
errors, and for getting text input from the user.

@cindex dialog, displaying a question dialog
@DOCSTRING(questdlg)

@cindex dialog, displaying a warning dialog
@DOCSTRING(warndlg)

@cindex dialog, displaying a font selection dialog
@DOCSTRING(uisetfont)

For creating new dialog types, there is a dialog function.

@node UI Elements
@section UI Elements

The @nospell{ui*} series of functions work best with the @code{qt} graphics
toolkit, although some functionality is available with the @code{fltk} toolkit.
There is no support for the @code{gnuplot} toolkit.

@DOCSTRING(uipanel)

@DOCSTRING(uibuttongroup)

@DOCSTRING(uicontrol)

@DOCSTRING(uitable)

@DOCSTRING(uimenu)

@DOCSTRING(uicontextmenu)

@DOCSTRING(uitoolbar)

@DOCSTRING(uipushtool)

@DOCSTRING(uitoggletool)

@node GUI Utility Functions
@section GUI Utility Functions

These functions do not implement a GUI element but are useful when developing
programs that do.  The functions @code{uiwait}, @code{uiresume}, and
@code{waitfor} are only available with the @code{qt} or @code{fltk} toolkits.

@DOCSTRING(guidata)

@DOCSTRING(guihandles)

@DOCSTRING(have_window_system)

@DOCSTRING(isguirunning)

@DOCSTRING(getpixelposition)

@DOCSTRING(listfonts)

@DOCSTRING(movegui)

@DOCSTRING(openvar)

@DOCSTRING(uiwait)

@DOCSTRING(uiresume)

@DOCSTRING(waitfor)

@node User-Defined Preferences

@node Octave Workspace Windows
@section Octave Workspace Windows

The functions below make windows that are a part of Octave's own GUI interface
visible, and move the keyboard focus to the selected window.  Their utility
lies in the ability to call these functions from a script and highlight a
window without using a mouse for selection.

@DOCSTRING(commandhistory)

@DOCSTRING(commandwindow)

@DOCSTRING(filebrowser)

@DOCSTRING(workspace)
