## @deftypefn {} {} bytecode ()
## Summary of commands related to Octave's bytecode interpreter.
##
## As of Octave 9, the bytecode interpreter is considered @emph{experimental}.
## The user is encouraged to test it with that in mind. All bytecode functions,
## being experimental, may be renamed in future.
##
## To switch on the bytecode interpreter, type: @code{__vm_enable__ (1)}
##
## To switch it off, type: @code{__vm_enable__ (0)}
##
## To always use it, add @code{__vm_enable__ (1)}
## to your Octave startup file (.octaverc or similar).
##
## For more information on each command and available options use
## @code{help CMD}.
##
## The other bytecode commands available in Octave are:
##
## @table @code
## @item __vm_compile__
## Compile a specified function to bytecode.
##
## @item __vm_profile__
## Profile the code running in the bytecode interpreter.
##
## @end table
##
## There are also several private functions whose names also begin with
## @code{__vm_}.  These are meant for developer use.
##
## @noindent
## @end deftypefn

function bytecode ()
  help ("bytecode");
endfunction

## Mark file as being tested.  No real test needed for a documentation .m file
