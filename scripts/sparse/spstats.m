## Return the stats for the nonzero elements of the sparse matrix @var{S}.
##
## @var{count} is the number of nonzeros in each column, @var{mean} is the mean
## of the nonzeros in each column, and @var{var} is the variance of the
## nonzeros in each column.
##
## Called with two input arguments, if @var{S} is the data and @var{j} is the
## bin number for the data, compute the stats for each bin.  In this case,
## bins can contain data values of zero, whereas with
## @code{spstats (@var{S})} the zeros may disappear.
