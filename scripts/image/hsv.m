## @deftypefn {} {} hsv (@var{n})
## Create color colormap.  This colormap begins with red, changes through
## yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta, before returning to red.
##
## It is useful for displaying periodic functions.  The map is obtained by
## linearly varying the hue through all possible values while keeping constant
## maximum saturation and value.  The equivalent code is
## @code{hsv2rgb ([(0:N-1)'/N, ones(N,2)])}.
##
## The argument @var{n} must be a scalar.
## If unspecified, the length of the current colormap, or 64, is used.
## @seealso{colormap}
## @end deftypefn

## A better demo of this colormap would be to plot the hsv values.
%!demo
%! ## Show the 'hsv' colormap profile and as an image
%! cmap = hsv (256);
%! subplot (2, 1, 1);
%!  rgbplot (cmap, "composite");
%! subplot (2, 1, 2);
%!  rgbplot (cmap);
