## @deftypefn {} {@var{I} =} ind2gray (@var{x}, @var{map})
## Convert a color indexed image to a grayscale intensity image.
##
## The image @var{x} must be an indexed image which will be converted using the
## colormap @var{map}.  If @var{map} does not contain enough colors for the
## image, pixels in @var{x} outside the range are mapped to the last color in
## the map before conversion to grayscale.
##
## The output @var{I} is of the same class as the input @var{x} and may be
## one of @code{uint8}, @code{uint16}, @code{single}, or @code{double}.
##
## Implementation Note: There are several ways of converting colors to
## grayscale intensities.  This functions uses the luminance value obtained
## from @code{rgb2gray} which is @code{I = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B}.
## Other possibilities include the value component from @code{rgb2hsv} or
## using a single color channel from @code{ind2rgb}.
## @seealso{gray2ind, ind2rgb}
## @end deftypefn

  [x, map] = ind2x ("ind2gray", x, map);

  ## Convert colormap to luminance intensity values
  map *= [0.29894; 0.58704; 0.11402];

  ## Convert colormap to same class as that of input so that reshape
  ## will produce output of the same type as the input.
  cls = class (x);
  if (isinteger (x))
    ## if we later add support for int16 images, this will not work.  Look into
    ## im2int16 from image package for such case
    map *= intmax (cls);
  elseif (strcmp (cls, "single"))
    map = single (map);
  endif

  ## Replace indices in the input matrix with the indexed luminance value.
