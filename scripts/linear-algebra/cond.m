## @deftypefn  {} {} cond (@var{A})
## @deftypefnx {} {} cond (@var{A}, @var{p})
## Compute the @var{p}-norm condition number of a matrix with respect to
## inversion.
##
## @code{cond (@var{A})} is defined as
## @tex
## $ {\parallel A \parallel_p * \parallel A^{-1} \parallel_p .} $
## @end tex
## @ifnottex
## @code{norm (@var{A}, @var{p}) * norm (inv (@var{A}), @var{p})}.
## @end ifnottex
##
## By default, @code{@var{p} = 2} is used which implies a (relatively slow)
## singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are
## @code{@var{p} = 1, Inf, "fro"} which are generally faster.  See @code{norm}
## for a full discussion of possible @var{p} values.
##
## The condition number of a matrix quantifies the sensitivity of the matrix
## inversion operation when small changes are made to matrix elements.  Ideally
## the condition number will be close to 1.  When the number is large this
## indicates small changes (such as underflow or round-off error) will produce
## large changes in the resulting output.  In such cases the solution results
## from numerical computing are not likely to be accurate.
