## @deftypefnx {} {@var{jmem} =} javamem ()
## Show the current memory usage of the Java virtual machine (JVM) and run the
## garbage collector.
##
## When no return argument is given the info is printed to the screen.
## Otherwise, the output cell array @var{jmem} contains Maximum, Total, and
## Free memory (in bytes).
##
## All Java-based routines are run in the JVM's shared memory pool, a
## dedicated and separate part of memory claimed by the JVM from your
## computer's total memory (which comprises physical RAM and virtual memory /
## swap space on hard disk).
##
## The maximum allowable memory usage can be configured using the file
## @file{java.opts}.  The directory where this file resides is determined by
## the environment variable @w{@env{OCTAVE_JAVA_DIR}}.  If unset, the directory
## where @file{javaaddpath.m} resides is used instead (typically
## @file{@w{@env{OCTAVE_HOME}}/share/octave/@w{@env{OCTAVE_VERSION}}/m/java/}).
##
## @file{java.opts} is a plain text file with one option per line.  The default
## initial memory size and default maximum memory size (which are both system
## dependent) can be overridden like so:
##
## @nospell{-Xms64m}
##
## @nospell{-Xmx512m}
##
## (in megabytes in this example).
## You can adapt these values to your own requirements if your system has
## limited available physical memory or if you get Java memory errors.
##
## @qcode{"Total memory"} is what the operating system has currently assigned
## to the JVM and depends on actual and active memory usage.
## @qcode{"Free memory"} is self-explanatory.  During operation of Java-based
## Octave functions the amount of Total and Free memory will vary, due to
## Java's own cleaning up and your operating system's memory management.
