## @deftypefn {} {} mustBeMember (@var{x}, @var{valid})
##
## Require that input @var{x} is a member of a set of given valid values.
##
## Raise an error if any element of the input @var{x} is not a member
## of the set @var{valid}, as determined by @code{ismember (@var{x})}.
##
## Programming Note: char inputs may behave strangely because of the
## interaction between chars and cellstrings when calling @code{ismember} on
## them.  But it will probably "do what you mean" if you just use it naturally.
## To guarantee operation, convert all char arrays to cellstrings with
## @code{cellstr}.
