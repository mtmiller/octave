## @deftypefn {} {} isprime (@var{x})
## Return a logical array which is true where the elements of @var{x} are prime
## numbers and false where they are not.
##
## A prime number is conventionally defined as a positive integer greater than
## 1 (e.g., 2, 3, @dots{}) which is divisible only by itself and 1.  Octave
## extends this definition to include both negative integers and complex
## values.  A negative integer is prime if its positive counterpart is prime.
## This is equivalent to @code{isprime (abs (x))}.
##
## If @code{class (@var{x})} is complex, then primality is tested in the domain
## of Gaussian integers (@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer}).
## Some non-complex integers are prime in the ordinary sense, but not in the
## domain of Gaussian integers.  For example, @math{5 = (1+2i)*(1-2i)} shows
## that 5 is not prime because it has a factor other than itself and 1.
## Exercise caution when testing complex and real values together in the same
## matrix.
##
## Examples:
##
## @example
## @group
## isprime (1:6)
##   @result{}  0  1  1  0  1  0
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @example
## @group
## isprime ([i, 2, 3, 5])
##   @result{}  0  0  1  0
## @end group
## @end example
##
## Programming Note: @code{isprime} is appropriate if the maximum value in
## @var{x} is not too large (< 1e15).  For larger values special purpose
## factorization code should be used.
##
## Compatibility Note: @sc{matlab} does not extend the definition of prime
## numbers and will produce an error if given negative or complex inputs.
