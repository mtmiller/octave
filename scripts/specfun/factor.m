## @deftypefn  {} {@var{pf} =} factor (@var{q})
## @deftypefnx {} {[@var{pf}, @var{n}] =} factor (@var{q})
## Return the prime factorization of @var{q}.
##
## The prime factorization is defined as @code{prod (@var{pf}) == @var{q}}
## where every element of @var{pf} is a prime number.  If @code{@var{q} == 1},
## return 1.  The output @var{pf} is of the same numeric class as the input.
##
## With two output arguments, return the unique prime factors @var{pf} and
## their multiplicities.  That is,
## @code{prod (@var{pf} .^ @var{n}) == @var{q}}.
##
## Implementation Note: If the input @var{q} is @code{single} or @code{double},
## then it must not exceed the corresponding @code{flintmax}.  For larger
## inputs, cast them to @code{uint64} if they're less than 2^64:
##
## @example
## @group
## factor (uint64 (18446744073709011493))
##    @result{}     571111    761213  42431951
## @end group
## @end example
##
## For even larger inputs, use @code{sym} if you have the Symbolic package
## installed and loaded:
##
## @example
## @group
## factor (sym ('9444733049654361449941'))
##    @result{} (sym)
##               1           1
