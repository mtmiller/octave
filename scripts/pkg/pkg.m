## Manage or query packages (groups of add-on functions) for Octave.
##
## Packages can be installed globally (i.e. for all users of the system) or
## locally (i.e. for the current user only).
##
## Global packages are by default installed in the "global packages store".
## That is usually located in a subdirectory of the folder where Octave itself
## is installed in.  Therefore, Octave needs write access to this folder to
## install global packages.  That usually means that Octave has to run with root
## access (or "Run as administrator") to be able to install packages globally.
##
## In contrast, local packages are by default installed in the user's profile
## and are only available to that specific user.  Usually, they can be installed
## without root access (or administrative privileges).
##
## For global and local packages, there are separate databases holding the
## information about the installed packages.  If some package is installed
## globally as well as locally, the local installation takes precedence over
## ("shadows") the global one.  Which package installation (global or local) is
## used can also be manipulated by using prefixes and/or using the
## @samp{local_list} input argument.  Using these mechanisms, several different
## releases of one and the same package can be installed side by side as well
## (but cannot be loaded simultaneouly).
##
## Packages might dependend on external software and/or other packages.  To be
## able to install such packages, these dependencies should be installed
## beforehand.  A package that depends on other package(s) can still be
## installed using the @qcode{"-nodeps"} flag.  The effects of unsatisfied
## dependencies on external software --- like libraries --- depends on the
## individual package.
##
## Packages must be loaded before they can be used.  When loading a package,
## Octave performs the following tasks:
## @enumerate
## @item
## If the package depends on other packages (and @code{pkg load} is called
## without the @qcode{"-nodeps"} option), the package is not loaded immediately.
## Instead, those dependencies are loaded first (recursively if needed).
##
## @item
## When all dependencies are satified, the package's subdirectories are added to
## the search path.
## @end enumerate
##
## This load order leads to functions that are provided by dependencies being
## potentially shadowed by functions of the same name that are provided by
## dependers.
##
## Each time, a package is added to the search path, initialization script(s)
## for the package are automatically executed if they are provided by the
## package.
##
## Depending on the value of @var{command} and on the number of requested return
## arguments, @code{pkg} can be used to perform several tasks.  Possible values
## for @var{command} are:
##
## @table @samp
##
## @item install
## Install named packages.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## installs the package found in the file @file{image-1.0.0.tar.gz}.  The
## file containing the package can be a URL, e.g.,
##
## @example
## pkg install 'http://somewebsite.org/image-1.0.0.tar.gz'
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## installs the package found in the given URL@.  This
## requires an internet connection and the cURL library.
##
## @noindent
## @emph{Security risk}: no verification of the package is performed
## before the installation.  It has the same security issues as manually
## downloading the package from the given URL and installing it.
##
## @noindent
## @emph{No support}: the GNU Octave community is not responsible for
## packages installed from foreign sites.  For support or for
## reporting bugs you need to contact the maintainers of the installed
## package directly (see the @file{DESCRIPTION} file of the package)
##
## The @var{option} variable can contain options that affect the manner
## in which a package is installed.  These options can be one or more of
##
## @table @code
## @item -nodeps
## The package manager will disable dependency checking.  With this option it
## is possible to install a package even when it depends on another package
## which is not installed on the system.  @strong{Use this option with care.}
##
## @item -local
## A local installation (package available only to current user) is forced,
## even if the user has system privileges.
##
## @item -global
## A global installation (package available to all users) is forced, even if
## the user doesn't normally have system privileges.
##
## @item -forge
## Install a package directly from the Octave Forge repository.  This
## requires an internet connection and the cURL library.
##
## @emph{Security risk}: no verification of the package is performed
## before the installation.  There are no signature for packages, or
## checksums to confirm the correct file was downloaded.  It has the
## same security issues as manually downloading the package from the
## Octave Forge repository and installing it.
##
## @item -verbose
## The package manager will print the output of all commands as
## they are performed.
## @end table
##
## @item update
## Check installed Octave Forge packages against repository and update any
## outdated items.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.
## Usage:
##
## @example
## pkg update
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## To update a single package use @code{pkg install -forge}
##
## @item uninstall
## Uninstall named packages.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg uninstall image
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## removes the @code{image} package from the system.  If another installed
## package depends on the @code{image} package an error will be issued.
## The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the @option{-nodeps} option.
##
## @item load
## Add named packages to the path.  After loading a package it is
## possible to use the functions provided by the package.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg load image
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## adds the @code{image} package to the path.
##
## Note: When loading a package, @code{pkg} will automatically try to load
## any unloaded dependencies as well, unless the @option{-nodeps} flag has
## been specified.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg load signal
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## adds the @code{signal} package and also tries to load its dependency: the
## @code{control} package.  Be aware that the functionality of package(s)
## loaded will probably be impacted by use of the @option{-nodeps} flag.  Even
## if necessary dependencies are loaded later, the functionality of depender
## packages can still be affected because the optimal loading order of may
## not have been followed.
##
## @item unload
## Remove named packages from the path.  After unloading a package it is
## no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package.  Trying
## to unload a package that other loaded packages still depend on will result
## in an error; no packages will be unloaded in this case.  A package can
## be forcibly removed with the @option{-nodeps} flag, but be aware that the
## functionality of depender packages will likely be affected.  As when loading
## packages, reloading dependencies after having unloaded them with the
## @option{-nodeps} flag may not restore all functionality of the depender
## packages as the required loading order may be incorrect.
##
## @item list
## Show the list of currently installed packages.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg list
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## will produce a short report with the package name, version, and installation
## directory for each installed package.  Supply a package name to limit
## reporting to a particular package.  For example:
##
## @example
## pkg list image
## @end example
##
## If a single return argument is requested then @code{pkg} returns a cell
## array where each element is a structure with information on a single
## package.
##
## @example
## installed_packages = pkg ("list")
## @end example
##
## If two output arguments are requested @code{pkg} splits the list of
## installed packages into those which were installed by the current user,
## and those which were installed by the system administrator.
##
## @example
## [user_packages, system_packages] = pkg ("list")
## @end example
##
## The @qcode{"-forge"} option lists packages available at the Octave Forge
## repository.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.
## For example:
##
## @example
## oct_forge_pkgs = pkg ("list", "-forge")
## @end example
##
## @item describe
## Show a short description of installed packages.  With the option
## @qcode{"-verbose"} also list functions provided by the package.  For
## example,
##
## @example
## pkg describe -verbose
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## will describe all installed packages and the functions they provide.
## Display can be limited to a set of packages:
##
## @example
## @group
## ## describe control and signal packages
## pkg describe control signal
## @end group
## @end example
##
## If one output is requested a cell of structure containing the
## description and list of functions of each package is returned as
## output rather than printed on screen:
##
## @example
## desc = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## If any of the requested packages is not installed, @code{pkg} returns an
## error, unless a second output is requested:
##
## @example
## [desc, flag] = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## @var{flag} will take one of the values @qcode{"Not installed"},
## @qcode{"Loaded"}, or
## @qcode{"Not loaded"} for each of the named packages.
##
## @item prefix
## Set the installation prefix directory.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## sets the installation prefix to @file{~/my_octave_packages}.
## Packages will be installed in this directory.
##
## It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an
## output argument.  For example:
##
## @example
## pfx = pkg ("prefix")
## @end example
##
## The location in which to install the architecture dependent files can be
## independently specified with an addition argument.  For example:
##
## @example
## pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages ~/my_arch_dep_pkgs
## @end example
##
## @item local_list
## Set the file in which to look for information on locally
## installed packages.  Locally installed packages are those that are
## available only to the current user.  For example:
##
## @example
## pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages
## @end example
##
## It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following
##
## @example
## pkg local_list
## @end example
##
## @item global_list
## Set the file in which to look for information on globally
## installed packages.  Globally installed packages are those that are
## available to all users.  For example:
##
## @example
## pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages
## @end example
##
## It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following
##
## @example
## pkg global_list
## @end example
##
## @item build
## Build a binary form of a package or packages.  The binary file produced
## will itself be an Octave package that can be installed normally with
## @code{pkg}.  The form of the command to build a binary package is
##
## @example
## pkg build builddir image-1.0.0.tar.gz @dots{}
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## where @code{builddir} is the name of a directory where the temporary
## installation will be produced and the binary packages will be found.
## The options @option{-verbose} and @option{-nodeps} are respected, while
## all other options are ignored.
##
## @item rebuild
## Rebuild the package database from the installed directories.  This can
## be used in cases where the package database has been corrupted.
##
## @item test
## Perform the built-in self tests contained in all functions provided by
## the named packages.  For example,
##
## @example
## pkg test image
## @end example
##
## @end table
## @seealso{ver, news}
## @end deftypefn
