## Control mesh hidden line removal.
##
## When called with no argument the hidden line removal state is toggled.
##
## When called with one of the modes @qcode{"on"} or @qcode{"off"} the state
## is set accordingly.
##
## The optional output argument @var{mode} is the current state.
##
## Hidden Line Removal determines what graphic objects behind a mesh plot
## are visible.  The default is for the mesh to be opaque and lines behind
## the mesh are not visible.  If hidden line removal is turned off then
## objects behind the mesh can be seen through the faces (openings) of the
## mesh, although the mesh grid lines are still opaque.
