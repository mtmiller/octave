## Prepare graphics engine to produce a new plot.
##
## This function is called at the beginning of all high-level plotting
## functions.  It is not normally required in user programs.  @code{newplot}
## queries the @qcode{"NextPlot"} field of the current figure and axes to
## determine what to do.
##
## @multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
## @headitem Figure NextPlot @tab Action
## @item @qcode{"new"} @tab Create a new figure and make it the current figure.
##
## @item @qcode{"add"} (default) @tab Add new graphic objects to the current
## figure.
##
## @item @qcode{"replacechildren"} @tab Delete child objects whose
## HandleVisibility is set to @qcode{"on"}.  Set NextPlot property to
## @qcode{"add"}.  This typically clears a figure, but leaves in place hidden
## objects such as menubars.  This is equivalent to @code{clf}.
##
## @item @qcode{"replace"} @tab Delete all child objects of the figure and
## reset all figure properties to their defaults.  However, the following
## four properties are not reset: Position, Units, PaperPosition, PaperUnits.
## This is equivalent to @code{clf reset}.
## @end multitable
##
## @multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
## @headitem Axes NextPlot @tab Action
## @item @qcode{"add"} @tab Add new graphic objects to the current axes.  This
## is equivalent to @code{hold on}.
##
## @item @qcode{"replacechildren"} @tab Delete child objects whose
## HandleVisibility is set to @qcode{"on"}, but leave axes properties
## unmodified.  This typically clears a plot, but preserves special settings
## such as log scaling for axes.  This is equivalent to @code{cla}.
##
## @item @qcode{"replace"} (default) @tab Delete all child objects of the
## axes and reset all axes properties to their defaults.  However, the
## following properties are not reset: Position, Units.  This is equivalent
## to @code{cla reset}.
## @end multitable
##
## If the optional input @var{hfig} or @var{hax} is given then prepare the
## specified figure or axes rather than the current figure and axes.
##
## The optional return value @var{hax} is a graphics handle to the created
## axes object (not figure).
##
## @strong{Caution:} Calling @code{newplot} may change the current figure and
## current axes.

## FIXME: The Matlab function takes an optional list of file handles, hsave,
##        which are not deleted when the figure and axes are prepared.
##        I'm sure there is a good reason for that, but coding such
##        compatibility is really tricky and doesn't serve much purpose since
##        newplot is nearly exclusively used by Octave's internal plotting
##        functions.  In Octave's case the argument is almost always null,
##        or occasionally the axes handle to plot into.
