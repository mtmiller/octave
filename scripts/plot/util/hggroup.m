## Create handle graphics group object with axes parent @var{hax}.
##
## If no parent is specified, the group is created in the current axes.
##
## Multiple property/value pairs may be specified for the hggroup, but they
## must appear in pairs.  The full list of properties is documented at
## @ref{Axes Properties}.
##
## The optional return value @var{h} is a graphics handle to the created
## hggroup object.
##
## Programming Note: An hggroup is a way to group base graphics objects such
## as line objects or patch objects into a single unit which can react
## appropriately.  For example, the individual lines of a contour plot are
## collected into a single hggroup so that they can be made visible/invisible
## with a single command, @code{set (hg_handle, "visible", "off")}.
