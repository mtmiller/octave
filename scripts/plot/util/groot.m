## Return a handle to the root graphics object.
##
## The root graphics object is the ultimate parent of all graphics objects.
##
## In addition, the root object contains information about the graphics
## system as a whole such as the @code{ScreenSize}.  Use @w{@code{get (groot)}}
## to find out what information is available.
##
## Defaults for the graphic system as a whole are specified by setting
## properties of the root graphics object that begin with @qcode{"Default"}.
## For example, to set the default font for all text objects to FreeSans use
##
## @example
## set (groot, "DefaultTextFontName", "FreeSans")
## @end example
##
## Default properties can be deleted by using @code{set} with the special
## property value of @qcode{"remove"}.  To undo the default font assignment
## above use
##
## @example
## set (groot, "DefaultTextFontName", "remove")
## @end example
##
## Programming Note: The root graphics object is identified by the special
## handle value of 0.  At some point this unique value may change, but code can
## be made resistant to future changes by using @code{groot} which is
## guaranteed to always return the root graphics object.
