## Produce a 2-D density plot.
##
## A @code{pcolor} plot draws rectangles with colors from the matrix @var{c}
## over the two-dimensional region represented by the matrices @var{x} and
## @var{y}.  @var{x} and @var{y} are the coordinates of the mesh's vertices
## and are typically the output of @code{meshgrid}.  If @var{x} and @var{y} are
## vectors, then a typical vertex is (@var{x}(j), @var{y}(i), @var{c}(i,j)).
## Thus, columns of @var{c} correspond to different @var{x} values and rows
## of @var{c} correspond to different @var{y} values.
##
## The values in @var{c} are scaled to span the range of the current
## colormap.  Limits may be placed on the color axis by the command
## @code{caxis}, or by setting the @code{clim} property of the parent axis.
##
## The face color of each cell of the mesh is determined by interpolating
## the values of @var{c} for each of the cell's vertices; Contrast this with
## @code{imagesc} which renders one cell for each element of @var{c}.
##
## @code{shading} modifies an attribute determining the manner by which the
## face color of each cell is interpolated from the values of @var{c},
## and the visibility of the cells' edges.  By default the attribute is
## @qcode{"faceted"}, which renders a single color for each cell's face with
## the edge visible.
##
## If the first argument @var{hax} is an axes handle, then plot into this axes,
## rather than the current axes returned by @code{gca}.
##
## The optional return value @var{h} is a graphics handle to the created
## surface object.
