## Produce a horizontal bar graph from two vectors of X-Y data.
##
## If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of Y values
## and the X coordinates are the range @code{1:numel (@var{y})}.
##
## The optional input @var{w} controls the width of the bars.  A value of
## 1.0 will cause each bar to exactly touch any adjacent bars.
## The default width is 0.8.
##
## If @var{y} is a matrix, then each column of @var{y} is taken to be a
## separate bar graph plotted on the same graph.  By default the columns
## are plotted side-by-side.  This behavior can be changed by the @var{style}
## argument which can take the following values:
##
## @table @asis
## @item @qcode{"grouped"} (default)
## Side-by-side bars with a gap between bars and centered over the
## Y-coordinate.
##
## @item  @qcode{"stacked"}
## Bars are stacked so that each Y value has a single bar composed of
## multiple segments.
##
## @item @qcode{"hist"}
## Side-by-side bars with no gap between bars and centered over the
## Y-coordinate.
##
## @item @qcode{"histc"}
## Side-by-side bars with no gap between bars and left-aligned to the
## Y-coordinate.
## @end table
##
## Optional property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying patch
## objects.  The full list of properties is documented at
## @ref{Patch Properties}.
##
## If the first argument @var{hax} is an axes handle, then plot into this axes,
## rather than the current axes returned by @code{gca}.
##
## The optional return value @var{h} is a graphics handle to the created
## bar series hggroup.  For a description of the use of the
## bar series, @pxref{XREFbar,,bar}.
