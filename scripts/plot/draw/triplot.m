## Plot a 2-D triangular mesh.
##
## @var{tri} is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the
## grid of @var{x}, @var{y}.  Every row of @var{tri} represents one triangle
## and contains three indices into [@var{x}, @var{y}] which are the
## vertices of the triangles in the x-y plane.
##
## The linestyle to use for the plot can be defined with the argument
## @var{linespec} of the same format as the @code{plot} command.
##
## The optional return value @var{h} is a graphics handle to the created
## patch object.
