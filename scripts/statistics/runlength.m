## Find the lengths of all sequences of common values.
##
## @var{count} is a vector with the lengths of each repeated value.
##
## The optional output @var{value} contains the value that was repeated in
## the sequence.

## @example
## @group
## runlength ([2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
## @result{}   2   1   3   1   4
