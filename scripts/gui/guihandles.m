## Return a structure of object handles for the figure associated with
## handle @var{h}.
##
## If no handle is specified the current figure returned by @code{gcf} is used.
##
## The fieldname for each entry of @var{hdata} is taken from the @qcode{"tag"}
## property of the graphic object.  If the tag is empty then the handle is not
## returned.  If there are multiple graphic objects with the same tag then
## the entry in @var{hdata} will be a vector of handles.  @code{guihandles}
## includes all possible handles, including those for
## which @qcode{"HandleVisibility"} is @qcode{"off"}.
