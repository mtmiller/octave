##
## Determine area of a polygon by triangle method.
##
## The variables @var{x} and @var{y} define the vertex pairs, and must
## therefore have the same shape.  They can be either vectors or arrays.  If
## they are arrays then the columns of @var{x} and @var{y} are treated
## separately and an area returned for each.
##
## If the optional @var{dim} argument is given, then @code{polyarea} works
## along this dimension of the arrays @var{x} and @var{y}.
##
## @end deftypefn

## FIXME: Add moments for centroid, etc.
##
## Bugs and limitations:
##        Probably ought to be an optional check to make sure that
##        traversing the vertices doesn't make any sides cross
##        (Is simple closed curve the technical definition of this?).
