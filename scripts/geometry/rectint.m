## @deftypefn {} {@var{area} =} rectint (@var{a}, @var{b})
## Compute area or volume of intersection of rectangles or N-D boxes.
##
## Compute the area of intersection of rectangles in @var{a} and rectangles in
## @var{b}.  N-dimensional boxes are supported in which case the volume, or
## hypervolume is computed according to the number of dimensions.
##
## 2-dimensional rectangles are defined as @code{[xpos ypos width height]}
## where xpos and ypos are the position of the bottom left corner.  Higher
## dimensions are supported where the coordinates for the minimum value of each
## dimension follow the length of the box in that dimension, e.g.,
## @code{[xpos ypos zpos kpos @dots{} width height depth k_length @dots{}]}.
##
## Each row of @var{a} and @var{b} define a rectangle, and if both define
## multiple rectangles, then the output, @var{area}, is a matrix where the i-th
## row corresponds to the i-th row of a and the j-th column corresponds to the
## j-th row of b.
